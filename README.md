# Hagiwo Eurorack Envelope Follower

This project is a through hole PCB version the HAGIWO 043 envelope follower. I also added a guitar jack input with more amplification to be able to plug in a variety of instruments.


## Hardware and PCB

You can find the schematic and BOM in the root folder. For the PCBs, the module has one circuit PCB and one panel PCB. You can order them on any common PCB manufacturing service, I used JLCPCB. Standard settings should be fine.
